## XDG Base Directories

The configuration follows the XDG Base Directory Specification for organizing configuration files:

- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`: `$HOME/.config`
- `XDG_DATA_HOME`: `$HOME/.local/share`
- `XDG_STATE_HOME`: `$HOME/.local/state`
- `XDG_CACHE_HOME`: `$HOME/.cache`

These directories are automatically created if they don't exist.

## Path Configuration

The configuration sets up various paths for functions and completions:

- Recursive function paths from `$__fish_config_dir/functions/*/`
- Recursive completion paths from `$__fish_config_dir/completions/*/`

## Theme and Appearance

The shell uses Catppuccin theme with automatic dark/light mode detection based on macOS system settings:

- Dark mode: [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://github.com/catppuccin/fish)
- Light mode: [Catppuccin Latte](https://github.com/catppuccin/fish)

## Cache Management

Cache files are managed in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fish`:

- Expired cache files (older than 1200 minutes) are automatically removed
- Cache initialization for various tools (brew, fzf, zoxide, etc.)
